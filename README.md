# 2.0 Updates

· The latest code updates the traditional BVH to TLAS & BLAS, but this update is not particularly meaningful, as I haven’t implemented operations for rigid body motion. In short, you may notice a significant slowdown in rendering performance when approaching objects.
· Another update involves slight modifications to the rendering algorithm, which are also not very meaningful. However, the code has changed significantly.
